# Moosie's Account Stuff Generator

Backstory (Just like a recipe)

A while ago at work while doing a lot of testing, I got sick of coming up with test account emails repeatedly.

Since I was learning JavaScript at the time, I decided to make a quick and dirty script to generate emails for me. Slowly that grew into a function that could accept multiple parameters including the current date to make each email unique based on the MM-DD.
